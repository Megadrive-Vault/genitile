# genitile
Genitile is a command line tool for converting pictures to megadrive  & genesis tile format. Itâ€™s versatile because the tool uses plugins for reading and outputing data.

Genitile is able to output:

    tiles
    sprites
    maps
    optimised tilesets (unused tiles,duplicates,flipped tiles removing)
    palettes

Currents plugins allow to:

    read pcx and bmp (256 colors only file)
    output the data (asm snasm68k, asm xgcc format, C header file and binary)
